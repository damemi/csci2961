## Lab 1

How to answer questions in a helpful way:
- Contribute to other answers. Commenting on high-upvoted answers to add more information can help expand the conversation to cover different setups and edge cases.
- It's sometimes helpful to provide sample code in some cases to explain common algorithms or implementations

For a project that interests me, I would like to work on an Android app, preferably in Java. I've worked on Android apps with Xamarin (C#) and iPhone apps using Objective-C, but have yet to contribute significantly to an Android project in Java. I'll find one that I can work on by searching the RCOS listings and on Github or, if possible, I can create my own project idea.
