## Lab 4

In this lab, I searched the FreeBSD man pages to find typos. Luckily, I was able to find one on the first page I searched which was the man page for ls(1). There is a section in that page which describes a "lexicographal" sort order. I submitted a patch to change "lexicographal" to "lexicographical", as the former does not seem to be a word. A link to my bug is here: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=203337. My bug is not a very important one. The semantic intent is still clear, but it is important in the sense that part of maintaining good documentation is maintaining professional documentation, without typos and grammar errors. Having clear documentation is important to help users understand and navigate your software.

In our debate last class, proprietary software seemed to be surprisingly favored. Personally, I think that proprietary software is the backbone of what even allows open source software to exist. Paying for software is what allows developers to get paid, so that they can get food and housing and most importantly be happy enough to contribute to projects outside of their work. One could argue that, without those evil corporations hiring programmers, they would have more time to contribute to open source projects.

If I was choosing a side project, I would want to make it open source (unless I really felt it could grow into a business someday). This way, I could show my project to other people who were interested and also receive feedback and contributions from those people. If I wanted to make a living off of it though, I would probably keep my code proprietary. The exception to this is if the code wasn't the actual product. If my business was to package the code into some proprietary hardware or even just to cut out a middleman to consumers, then my code could be open source while still being profitable.
