Comparing results:
Gitstats seems to get more accurate results than manually executing commands to count the lines of code in each project. This may be due to the fact that not every line of every file is "code", but rather different filetypes that can still technically be read (even though we don't really want to count the length of, say, compiled files as code). There are also differences in the number of contributors, which may be due to differences in Git commit signatures or Github usernames/accounts.
